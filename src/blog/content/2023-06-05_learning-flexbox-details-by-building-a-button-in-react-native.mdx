Imaging we need to build a simple UI for an article preview. Something like this one:

![Article preview design](/images/2023-06-05/1.webp)

Let's start building it from the bottom. Why not? 🙃

We can use the [Pressable](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable) and [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text) components to create the "Learn more" button.

```tsx
import { Text, Pressable } from 'react-native'

type Props = {
  children: string
}

export const Button = ({ children }: Props) => {

  return (
    <Pressable style={({pressed}) => ({
      padding: 12,
      borderWidth: 1,
      borderRadius: 6,
      backgroundColor: pressed ? 'lightyellow' : 'white',
    })}>
      <Text>{children}</Text>
    </Pressable>
  )
}
```

Pretty simple, right?

But wait, why is the button stretched full width? 🤔

We did not use the `flex: 1`, `flexGrow: 1`, or `width: '100%'` in our styles. 😬

Let's try to find the answer in the React Native [Flexbox](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox) docs.

![Flex doc](/images/2023-06-05/3.webp)

> `flex` will define how your items are going to “fill” over the available space along your **main** axis.

Ok, `flex` controls only the "main" axis. But what is the "main" axis?

![Flex direction doc](/images/2023-06-05/4.webp)

> `flexDirection` controls the direction in which the children of a node are laid out. This is also referred to as the **main** axis. The **cross** axis is the axis perpendicular to the **main** axis, or the axis which the wrapping lines are laid out in (`flexDirection` is default to `column`).

![The main and cross axises](/images/2023-06-05/5.webp)

So, according to the docs the "main" axis for React Native by default is directed from top to bottom (which is different for the web❗️). It means, that in our case, `flex` and `flexGrow` styles do not affect the width of the button.

And what about the "cross" axis?

![Align items doc](/images/2023-06-05/6.webp)

> `alignItems` describes how to align children along the **cross** axis of their container. It is very similar to `justifyContent` but instead of applying to the **main** axis, `alignItems` applies to the **cross** axis (`alignItems` is default to `stretch`).

Eureka! That is it. As we can see now, for every element we add, the default behaviour for the "cross" axis will be `stretch`. That is why our button is stretched full width.

Let's try to fix it!

To do that, we need to change the "align" style for the "cross" axis, right? Theoretically, we can wrap the `Pressible` component with the `View` component and set the `alignItems` style for the wrapper `View` component to `flex-start`.

```tsx
import { Text, Pressable, View } from 'react-native';

type Props = {
  children: string;
};

export const Button = ({ children }: Props) => {
  return (
    <View style={{ alignItems: 'flex-start' }}>
      <Pressable
        style={({ pressed }) => ({
          padding: 12,
          borderWidth: 1,
          borderRadius: 6,
          backgroundColor: pressed ? 'lightyellow' : 'white',
        })}>
        <Text>{children}</Text>
      </Pressable>
    </View>
  );
}
```

Looks good! 😻

But can we do it better without the "extra" `View` component? The answer is yes, we can! 💪

![Align self doc](/images/2023-06-05/8.webp)

> alignSelf has the same options and effect as alignItems but instead of affecting the children within a container, you can apply this property to a single child to change its alignment within its parent.

Wow, that is exactly what we need! 🎉

We just need to apply the `alignSelf: 'flex-start'` style to the `Pressible` component. Let's try it.

```tsx
import { Text, Pressable } from 'react-native';

type Props = {
  children: string;
};

export const Button = ({ children }: Props) => {
  return (
    <Pressable
      style={({ pressed }) => ({
        padding: 12,
        borderWidth: 1,
        borderRadius: 6,
        backgroundColor: pressed ? 'lightyellow' : 'white',
        alignSelf: 'flex-start',
      })}>
      <Text>{children}</Text>
    </Pressable>
  );
};
```

Yey! It is what we wanted to achieve. 🥳

I feel like we learned a lot just by building a simple button. That's amazing! 😊
