```typescript
export default function A() {}

// vs

export function A() {}
```

I think that both methods are good. But I can see some advantages of named exports.

## Named exports will not allow to implicitly change the import name

```typescript
// No error with default export
import Button from '../components/Text'
// now we have a "Button" component
// which is actually a "Text" component

// TypeScript will throw and error
// if import and export names don't match
import { Button } from '../components/Text'
// we will get an error here
```

## Named exports are easier to re-export and organise

Imagine we have several UI components inside `components` folder. Each component in a separate file: `components/Header.tsx`, `components/Text.tsx`, `components/Button.tsx`, etc.

Now to be able to import these components as `import { Header, Text, Button } from '../components'` we just need to create the `components/index.ts`.

```typescript
export * from './Header'
export * from './Text'
export * from './Button'
```

Compare to the default exports where will  need to write:
```typescript
export { default as Header } from './Header'
export { default as Text } from './Text'
export { default as Button } from './Button'
```

## Named exports are shorter to write

```typescript
export function Component() {}
// or
export const Component = () => {}
```

Compared to default exports:

```typescript
export default function Component() {}
// or
const Component = () => {}
export default Component
```

Happy hacking! 🙌🏻
