In React we are using `props` to control our components. But sometimes we need more...

Let us imaging we are building a custom form input component. And then we need to focus it when something happens in our app. How should we do this?

We can easily get a `reference` to the component with the `ref` prop.

```ts
...
const ref = useRef()

...
<FormInput ref={ref} />
...
```

But how we can expose a method from a functional component? 🤔

We can use the `useImperativeHandle` [hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useImperativeHandle)!

```ts
...

export const FormInput = ({ label, placeholder, ref }: Props) => {
  const inputRef = useRef<TextInput>(null)

  const focus = () => {
    inputRef.current?.focus()
  }

  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {
    return {
      focus
    }
  }, [])

  return (
    <View>
      <Text style={styles.label}>{label}</Text>
      <TextInput ref={inputRef} style={styles.input} placeholder={placeholder} placeholderTextColor="gray" />
    </View>
  )
}

...
```

Here we have created the `focus` function and then exposed it with the `useImperativeHandle` hook. Now we can use this function in our parent component.

```ts
...

const formInputRef = useRef()

...
  // use the ref to focus the component
  formInputRef.current.focus()
...

return <FormInput ref={formInputRef} />

...
```

Yay! 🎉

❗But... do not overuse refs. We should only use refs for imperative behaviors that we can not express as props (scrolling to a node, focusing a node, triggering an animation, selecting text, etc). If we can express something as a prop, we should not use a ref.
