In general, conditional rendering in React Native is the same as in [React](https://en.reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html). But be aware, that in React Native we can render strings only inside the `Text` component. So, for example, if we will try to put a string inside a `View` we will get an error.

## Inline if with logical "&&" operator.

```jsx
<View>
  {!!error && <ErrorMessage />}
</View>
```

☝🏻 Double negation `!!` operator is very important here (also we can use the `Boolean` function), because it ensures that the left part of the condition will be a boolean value.

Why it is important? Because logical “and” operator `&&` will return the right side of the condition if the left side is `truthy`. And will return the left side of the condition if the left side is `falsy`.

Imaging we have a component:
```jsx
<View>
  {error && <ErrorMessage />}
</View>
```

If the `error` variable will be an `object`, `null` or `undefined` everything will work as expected. But if we will get an empty string for the error (`error = ''`) then our component will brake, because we can’t render strings inside a `View` component.

```jsx
// error = ''
// {error && <something>} will return the error variable,
// which equals to the empty string and we will get:
<View>
  ''
</View>
// which will throw an error, because we
// can't render strings inside a View
```


## Inline "if-else" with ternary "?" operator.

```jsx
{error ? <ErrorMessage /> : <SuccessMessage />}
```
or
```jsx
{error ? <ErrorMessage /> : null}
```

Here we can return `null` or `<></>` (React Fragment) depend on our component structure and return type.

## "if" statement

```jsx
...

const Error = () => {
  if (!error) {
    return null
  }

  return <ErrorMessage />
}

return (
  <View>
    <Error />
  </View>
)
```
